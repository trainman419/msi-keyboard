This program can change the colors on your MSI steelseries keyboard. The keyboards have 3 regions that can have different colors for each one.

Prerequisites (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 only):

Qt 5.2 or later (Ubuntu includes Qt 5.2.1):
qtbase5-dev (maybe?)

libhidapi-dev
libhidapi-libusb0

To build:

qtchooser -run-tool=qmake -qt=5
make

Make sure to copy 99-msi.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d unless you want to run the program as root. Requires a reboot or maybe just a reload of udev rules to work correctly.
